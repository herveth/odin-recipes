        <p><strong>This Lemon Rosemary Roasted Whole Chicken,</strong> has the best crispy, buttery skin and juicy meat cooked over shallots for an easy chicken dinner prepared in one pan.</p>
        
        <p>There is so much flavor in this Roasted Whole Chicken with fresh rosemary, lemon, garlic, and shallots. While roasting, the aromatics infuse the meat and the butter crisps the skin for the juiciest chicken dinner, all cooked in one pan. My favorite part of this easy whole-roasted chicken recipe is the butter melting into the bottom of the pan with chicken drippings and shallots. You can make one delicious gravy to spoon over the chicken and pair it with some tasty sides.</p>

        <p>If you’re looking for a family-friendly chicken recipe full of flavor, easy to make, and a true show-stopper, then this simple lemon herb whole-roasted chicken dish is exactly what you need. Pair with a vegetable and a side like roasted potatoes or broccoli macaroni and cheese for a meal that will please kids and adults alike!

        <h3>Ingredients to make roasted whole Roasted-chicken<h3>
            
        <UL>
            <li><strong>Whole chicken:</strong> For best results, remove the whole chicken from the fridge and set it on the counter to come to room temperature before cooking.</li>

            <li><strong>Shallots:</strong> Shallots have a mild, delicate flavor that I love using with chicken. For a similar flavor, you can use any onion, such as red, white or yellow onions.</li>

            <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> lemon, garlic, and rosemary. These 3 ingredients bring out the best flavor and scent of the chicken from the inside.</li>

            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> For the crispiest and most tasty skin, slather butter over the chicken skin before roasting.</li> 

            <li><strong>Salt & pepper:</strong> This is all you need because of the aromatics you’re using. But feel free to add other seasoning like paprika, onion powder or oregano.</li>

        <h3>My Greek Salad Dressing</h3>   
        
           <p>I toss the veggies, olives, and feta cheese in an easy homemade Greek salad dressing. With just 5 ingredients + salt and pepper, it’s super simple to whisk together, and it gives this easy Greek salad recipe a bright, zingy flavor.<strong></strong> It’s a simple mix of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, and dried oregano.</p>

           <p>In addition to using them in the dressing, I like to sprinkle my salad with generous pinches of oregano and black pepper for a fresh, peppery garnish.</p>

        <h3>Serving Suggestions</h3>   

           <p>Because this salad doesn’t have any tender greens, it’s a good one to make ahead for gatherings. If I’m prepping it ahead, I like to save a few fresh mint leaves to add right before serving. It’s also an excellent dinner side.</p>
