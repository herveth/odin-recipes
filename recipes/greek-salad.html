        <p><strong>I love a good green salad,</strong> it's a good starting point for fresh, healthy meals. But summer is a time when all vegetables are at their peak. Sweet, juicy tomatoes, snappy bell peppers, and crisp cucumbers abound. This Greek salad recipe,<em> known as “Horiatiki”, meaning “from a village”,</em> showcases these veggies, without any greens to get in the way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Because the vegetables are in their prime, this Greek salad recipe is flavorful and refreshing with just a few ingredients.</strong> You only need 7 ingredients + an easy homemade Greek salad dressing to make it! It’s been a hit at our family gatherings over the last few weeks – my mom even added it to her regular recipe rotation. I hope you love it as much as we do!</p>

        <h3>Greek Salad Ingredients</h3>

           <P><strong>A traditional Greek salad consists of sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, green bell pepper, red onion, olives, and feta cheese.</strong> This classic combination is delicious, so I stick to it, just adding a handful of mint leaves for a fresh finishing touch.</P>  
  
           <p>My olives of choice are Kalamata olives. Commonly used in Greek food, their salty, briny flavor is delectable alongside the feta and crisp veggies. Instead of slicing large tomatoes, I use cherry tomatoes because they release less water into the salad than larger tomatoes would. I also seed my cucumber to avoid making my salad watery.</p>          
            
           <p>A great salad will have a yummy jumble of veggies, olives, and cheese in each bite, so be sure to cut your ingredients into similar-sized pieces. I like to buy pitted Kalamata olives and leave them whole, and I chop the feta into 1/2-inch cubes instead of crumbling it. I aim for 1-inch squares for the bell pepper, cut the cucumber into thin half-moons, and simply halve the cherry tomatoes.</p> 
            
            
        <h3>My Greek Salad Dressing</h3>   
        
           <p>I toss the veggies, olives, and feta cheese in an easy homemade Greek salad dressing. With just 5 ingredients + salt and pepper, it’s super simple to whisk together, and it gives this easy Greek salad recipe a bright, zingy flavor.<strong></strong> It’s a simple mix of olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, and dried oregano.</p>

           <p>In addition to using them in the dressing, I like to sprinkle my salad with generous pinches of oregano and black pepper for a fresh, peppery garnish.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Serving Suggestions</h3>   

           <p class="text">Because this salad doesn’t have any tender greens, it’s a good one to make ahead for gatherings. If I’m prepping it ahead, I like to save a few fresh mint leaves to add right before serving. It’s also an excellent dinner side.</p>
